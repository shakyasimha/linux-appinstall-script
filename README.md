# linux-appinstall-script

A script for reinstalling apps I use on different Linux distros.
Still a work in progress. 
I've written two scripts, one for Ubuntu and its derivatives, and other for Arch and its derivatives, the two distros I use often.
The third one, its a script for removing snapd from Ubuntu and installing Flatpak.
